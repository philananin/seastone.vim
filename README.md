seastone.vim
============

I've spent quite some time crafting a colorscheme for Visual Studio that I can use for work that I really love.
You can find that here: https://gist.github.com/philananin/4043615489019eee7e09

I've tried to reproduce the theme for vim here. It's a work-in-progress, but I'm pleased enough with what I have so far that I already use it as my default colorscheme.

Installation
============

You could clone it into your .vim directory if you wanted to:

```
git clone git@github.com:philananin/seastone.vim.git ~/.vim
```

Or you could use [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) with a git submodule:

```
cd ~/.vim
git submodule add git@github.com:philananin/seastone.vim.git bundles/seastone
```

Or you could just use [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) like I do and add this to your .vimrc:

```
Plugin 'philananin/seastone.vim'
```
